One goal I have during my 3 weeks of funemployment is to read `Godel, Escher, Bach` (GEB).
The book is about Godel's Incompleteness Theorem -- what it means, how it was derived, and the implications of this discovery.

I think GEB is meant for for an audience unfamiliar with formal systems of math and logic, and Hofstadter does a good job of helping the reader build an intuition around these abstract topics using more concrete examples in music and art, and through silly dialogues between fictional characters. Skimming these 'creative anecdotes' is fine if you already have a solid background on computability, but I found these snippets pretty playful, and I learned a fair bit of Bach & Escher trivia in the process.

My write-up of the book will be targeted for a similar audience as well: those unfamiliar with formal systems of math and logic.

The whole book is building up to understanding Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which is ultimately a meta-claim about formal systems of number theory. So before we can discuss the theorem, we have to build an understanding of what constitutes a formal system of number theory.

### Introduction to Formal Systems: the MU-puzzle

The first half of GEB introduces the reader to formal systems, starting from a simple MU-puzzle, then moving on to Propositional Calculus, then finally to Typographical Number Theory (TNT) -- a system that appears to be made up by Hofstadter himself to help explain Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. Here, I'm only going to discuss the MU-puzzle, which I think is enough to illustrate what 'formal systems' are, so that we can get a sense of what Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is about, at a high level.

The MU-Puzzle: Can you produce the string 'MU' from the string 'MI', using the rules below?

+ Rule I: If the string ends in the letter 'I', you can add a 'U' at the end
+ Rule II: If you have the string Mx, you can create Mxx.
  - 'x' here is a stand-in for any substring containing any character.
  - e.g. MIIU => MIIU + IIU => MIIUIIU
+ Rule III: Replace any substring 'III' with the letter 'U'.
  - MIII => MU
  - MIIII => MUI or MIU
+ Rule IV: You can delete the 'UU' substring if it occurs anywhere in the string.
  - MIUU => MI
  - UUU => U

One way to go about answering this question is to try and generate all the possible theorems from the starting string and the given rules, and see if MU ever comes up. Something like this:

![MU]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mu.png)

As you can see, the tree would grow infinitely, and there's no guarantee that MU will show up in the tree.

The MU puzzle is a simple example of a formal system (let's call it the MIU-system). Formal systems generally consist of the following:
- Symbols: A list of valid symbols/characters for the system. In the MIU-system, the valid symbols are: M, I, U.
- Axioms: A starting string of valid symbols -- the top node in our graph above. For the MU-system, we only have one axiom, the string 'MI'.
- Rules (also called rules of production or rules of inference): rules tells us how to manipulate/generate new strings. In the MIU-system, we have 4 rules, some of which lengthen and some of which shorten the given string to produce new strings.
- Theorems: Any string can be a theorem if it can be derived from the axiom(s) using the rules of inference. To derive is to demonstrate, line-by-line, how applying different rules of the system can take us from the axiom to some new string.

So the initial question "Can you produce 'MU' from 'MI' using the four given rules?" is equivalent to asking: "Is the string MU a theorem of the MIU-system?"

Formal systems about numbers (aka math) are constructed in the same way as the MIU-system, except there are more symbols, more axioms, and more complicated rules. Ultimately, we want to formalize a way of expressing truths about numbers:
1. 5 is prime
2. 2 is not a square
3. 1729 is a sum of two cubes
4. No sum of two positive cubes is itself a cube
5. There are infinitely many prime numbers

.
.
.

It's not hard to imagine that there are infinitely many true statements about natural numbers. Well, we'd like to capture ALL the true statements if possible using some formal system, without running ourselves into contradictions. And we'd like to be able to show that our system is robust enough to achieve this goal.

Such a system would be considered 'consistent' and 'complete'.

Consistency: Everything produced by the system is true.

Completeness: Every true statement (that can be expressed in the notation of the system) is produced by the system.

If such a system existed, we know that every statement, or its negation, can be proven/derived within the system. We could collapse the concepts of provability and truth -- what is true is provable, and vice versa. No truth (expressible in the notation of the system) is out of reach of the system.

### Overview: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

Unfortunately, or fortunately, Godel shows us that such a system does not exist.
Here is Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, paraphrased in English:

> All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.

An undecidable proposition is one which cannot be proven nor refuted in the formal system -- a string that we cannot generate from the given rules and axioms.

So Godel is pointing out an inherent shortcoming in all formal systems that are consistent and axiomatizable. These systems are 'incomplete' because you can't derive all the true statements of the system from its axioms and rules. Mathematicians and logicians at the time were trying to come up with such a 'complete' and consistent system of mathematics, derived from pure logic. So needless to say, this was really bad news for them. Von Neuman put it more bluntly:

> I think that [the Incompleteness Theorem] has solved negatively the foundational question: There is no rigorous justification for classical mathematics.

How did Godel manage to do this? *Godel's discovery involves the translation of an ancient paradox in philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is the so-called Epimenides paradox, or liar paradox.*

A paraphrase of the ancient liar paradox:

> This statement is false.

If this statement is true, then it is false. If the statement is false, then it is true. This is unacceptable -- in formal systems, as is with common sense, we don't allow for something to be true and false at the same time.

Godel managed to translate the liar paradox into mathematical terms -- into a string that we shall call 'G'. String 'G' talks about itself:

> G is not a theorem of [some formal, consistent, and axiomatizable system].

Assuming that all theorems of the formal system are true ('consistency'), if G is a theorem, then it contains a truth about itself, namely, that it is NOT a theorem.
But then we have a situation where G is a theorem and not a theorem at the same time.
We could avoid this contradiction by concluding that G is not a theorem.
However, we've then uncovered a true statement which is not a theorem of the formal system.
By concluding that G is indeed not a theorem, we know that G is true, but unprovable within the system, so we know the system is incomplete.

Why is it important that Godel was able to translate the liar paradox into mathematical terms?

To show that there are inherent limitations to what can be achieved with formal systems. Godel shows that you can use the system's own rules and axioms on itself, to demonstrate its own 'incompleteness'. Any system that is powerful enough to express the sentence G is incomplete.
And as it turns out, most systems we're interested in, systems that are powerful enough to capture many true statements about numbers, are also powerful enough to generate the sentence G, thereby proving its own incompleteness.

Why should you care?

It's kind of a fun puzzle to understand how Godel managed to construct a meta-statement within a formal mathematical system -- a statement of number theory that is also about number theory.
It's an interesting rumination on what it means to be self-reflexive (our thinking, after all, is infinitely reflexive: "I think X", "I am thinking about the statement, 'I think X'", etc.)
