What I'm reading this morning: [Containment as Signal: Swine Flu Risk Miscommunication](https://www.psandman.com/col/swineflu2.htm).

The article was written in 2009, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic which infected about 11-20% of the world, though the mortality rate ended up being pretty low at `0.03%`. The authors write:
> Containment is first and foremost a public health strategy. But we are fascinated by its use as a profoundly misleading de facto risk communication strategy.

Containment includes a few measures like:
- Closing schools under conditions where they would have been kept open during a "normal" flu outbreak, and often keeping them closed longer.
- Canceling events that bring large numbers of people together, including sporting events, plays, concerts, and graduation ceremonies.
- Testing people with flu symptoms, then tracing their contacts if they test positive, and then quarantining the contacts in case they might have been infected.
- Treating travelers from affected countries differently from one’s own populace – in particular, screening arriving passengers for symptoms (especially fever), isolating those who test positive, and quarantining their contacts and seatmates.

The point of containment, in response to the flu pandemic, is to slow the spread of the disease, to buy time for public health institutions to educate the public and prepare for the onslaught of people who has the disease or who think they have the disease.
It is not meant to prevent the spread of the disease altogether. It is not possible to prevent the spread of the flu pandemic.

And yet, containment measures often signal to the public that:
- The disease can be prevented altogether (completely false for the flu)
- The disease is very severe or deadly (not necessarily true, but implied by the severity of the containment measures taken)

Many governments don't take special care to counter these signals in their messaging about containment measures.
In fact, some governments intentionally mislead their people in an attempt to reassure them.
But this is trading off short-term reassurance for longer-term fear, anger, mistrust -- soon or later, the people will realize that the flu pandemic cannot be contained as promised.
Worse, the miscommunication and false expectations may lead to a misdirection of scarce public health resources -- that is, public pressure will increase on governments to enact ineffective and expensive containment measures, instead of spending resources to prepare hospitals and other public health institutions to deal with the influx of patients.

Governments that miscommunicate the signals of containment (intentionally or otherwise) are later tempted to stick to the containment strategy long after it is useful -- because to admit that containment has failed is to let down the public who now believes that containment should work to totally prevent the disease.

Of course, I'm currently reading this article with the COVID-19 pandemic on my mind. It's hard to compare the current situation to the swine flu situation discussed in the article. In particular, it's really hard to say whether we're pushing for more containment measures than is necessary, due to the reasons listed in the article.

Initially there was hope that the disease could be contained to China, but that period has long passed -- community spread has appeared in many places outside China.

Still, we're pushing for containment, because in countries like China, Singapore, S Korea, containment measures have proven effective for significantly slowing down the spread of the virus. Currently, at least in the US, there's an emphasis on containment to help 'flatten the curve': to avoid over-burdening our hospitals and healthcare systems, we should try to not all get sick at the same time.
For the individual, this means avoiding large public gatherings, avoid non-essential travels, working from home, practicing good hygiene, etc.
For the government, this means shutting down schools, banning large events/gatherings, and quarantining whole cities. Italy has just decided to shut down the whole country and closing down all non-essential commercial areas.
It seems likely that more aggressive containment measures will continue to be enforced by different countries as the disease continues to spread.

I guess there's a fair overlap between containment and mitigation measures, and it's not important to be precise on the definitions here. What's important is: Which measures are still effective and worth taking? Which measures are governments pressured to take, but for the wrong reasons and would be ineffective and a waste of resources? Obviously I don't have all the answers, but it's good to keep in mind the signaling effects of containment, and the social/political dynamics that containment put in place.
