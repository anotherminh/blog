It's been a desire of mine for a while now to *write more*. Outside of irregular therapeutic stream-of-consciousness-journaling, I haven't done much creative writing since college.
This is a shame, because I really enjoy the writing process when I get to do it.
So what better project to undertake when I find myself with 3 weeks of free time in between jobs? Set up a blog and write, of course!

This weekend I played through the entire game `What Remains of Edith Finch`. It's a narrative adventure game, the type that often has me wondering, "Did this really need to be a video game? Or is it just a subpar movie that's made a a bit more special through some interactivity? What is added by making it a game?" For this genre, there are often minimal game mechanics (many are point-and-click walking simulations). Minimal mechanics can be repetitive or boring, and I'm often annoyed by the tideousness of having to *press a button just to advance the story*. But if done right, the genre really invites the player to inhabit the world much more deeply than is usually achievable through more passive means of consuming media.

(An aside: There's also the genre of visual novels, which I distinguish from narrative-driven adventure games. IMO visual novels are really just choose-your-own-adveture books in digital forms. I have nothing against them and their minimal gameplay -- the experience of clicking to choose your adventure and then 'digitally flipping the page' are both improvements over the original, physical book form. What I dislike is when the game creator has invented some more involved mechanics that are tedious and don't add anything to the experience of the narrative.)

Overall, I really enjoyed `What Remains of Edith Finch`. Edith Finch is the protagonist of the story and the character that you control. As Edith, you explore the abandoned family home where you grew up, in order to try and piece together the Finch family history.

**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD**

The family home is a huge house, with many sealed off rooms and secret passages.  We quickly learn that many Finches have lived here, but all have died/gone missing. Their rooms in the family home are preserved perfectly by grandmother Edie Finch, as a memorial for each of the deceased. In each room, you learn about the deceased family member through inspecting different memorabilia, and through a 'minigame' experience that transports you to the point of view of the deceased, moments before they die. The entire game can be thought of as an anthology of minigames, one for each deceased family member.

There's something really unsettling about playing as a character who's about to die -- worse, the mechanics of the game is such that you are somehow contributing to your own death.

In one episode, you're playing as Calvin Finch, a excitable and reckless 11-year-old boy, who's playing on a swing set that's situated on top of a cliff, overlooking the ocean.
There's no instruction, so it's not always clear what you're supposed to do. You press buttons and see what happens -- ah, one leg is controlled by one joystick, and the other leg controlled by the other joystick.
As you move the joystick back and forth, you're creating momentum for yourself on the swing.

This is all you can do -- swinging back and forth, going higher and higher.

You're told by the narration (a written eulogy by Calvin's twin brother, Sam), that you've always wanted to swing all the way around the tree. So this is what you do. You try to go all the way around. And when that happens, the wind picks up and you're flying through the air, into the ocean. This is how Calvin died.

It's very anti-video-game-instincts to play with the goal of dying. We're supposed to avoid dying, because dying feels punishing and you have to repeat from the last checkpoint. Here, you have to die to advance the gameplay.

Death is certainly a morbid topic, but the game managed to make it beautiful and sometimes playful. (And what is the point of making death seem beautiful or playful? To help us come to terms with it, I guess. Make peace with the inevitable.)

One of most playful and the saddest episodes involves baby Gregory Finch, playing in the bath tub. His mom steps away to answer a call. She's gone for a while. You play as Gregory's toy frog, hopping around the tub, knocking down more toys that were sitting on the shelves or on the edge of the tub. The toys swim and dance. This makes Gregory laughs. Eventually you, the frog, manage to jump and hit the bath's faucet. The tub overflows. The scene cuts to baby Gregory swimming in a large body of water -- what looks like the open sea. His toys, now larger-than-life-sized, are dancing around him. He looks up and sees the bathroom of his home. But he is compelled to dive towards a large opening at the bottom of the water -- the drain, which has a bright light shining through.

In his death you can see the playfulness of his world while he was alive -- you are Gregory's imagination coming to life.

The episode that stayed with me the most, one where I felt the game mechanics really helped to elevate my experience of the narrative, was the episode involving Lewis Finch, the protagonist's older brother.

Lewis was a twenty-something young man who struggled with substance abuse. He's been seeing a therapist, and his mom got him a job a the local cannery. You play as Lewis during one of his shifts at the cannery. His job? Processing salmon by sliding them under an automated guillotine to behead them, then throwing their carcass onto another conveyor belt. We're told by the narration (Lewis' therapist) that Lewis often escaped the dullness of his work through daydreaming.

The daydreaming sequence begins to take up a small part of the screen. It starts out as a simple 2D maze, and you're controlling both Lewis-in-the-dream and Lewis-in-the-cannery, one with the left joystick and the other one with the right. You're told by the narration that, as Lewis' reliance on substance wears off, he retreats more and more into his imagination. The dream world becomes more elaborate, and it takes up more and more of the screen. Soon, we can barely see the real Lewis in the cannery. But we know he's still there through the distinctive chopping sounds made by the guillotine. We know we're still 'controlling' that Lewis, because if we do nothing, we don't hear the chopping sound. It's possible to play Lewis-in-the-cannery without actually seeing anything from that world because the mechanics are extremely simple -- you just slide left to pick up the salmon, then right to place it under the guillotine, then up after you hear the chopping sound. Repeat. The Lewis-in-the-daydream sequence is more complex and requires more varied input from the player as "Prince Lewis" travels through his kingdom, conquering new lands and winning the praise of all. The experience of playing this episode was a really effective way to demonstrate the duality of Lewis' experience. It's heavily implied that Lewis died through injuries sustanied by the guillotine.

Playing this game was an interesting meditation on death and grief -- heavy topics that would've been too sentimental or severe if not for the creativity and surrealism weaved into each story. We can't fully comprehend death, so it's only fitting, comfortable perhaps, to wrap it inside impossible stories that don't fully make sense.

Other video games of this genre that I've played: `Gone Home`, `Life is Strange`, `Oxenfree`, `Florence`. I think `Bandersnatch` (Netflix) fits into this category, too. Perhaps that's the one most folks are familiar with. Note: Unlike some of these other titles, there's only one possible narrative with `Edith Finch`. There's replay value in that you might notice more stuff the second time around, but ultimately that's not really the point.
